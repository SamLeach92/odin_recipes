            <li>175g pack baby corn</li>
            <li>1 large red onion , sliced (190g)</li>
            <li>1 red pepper , deseeded and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>½ tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large ripe kiwi , halved lengthways (110g)</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, halved (115g)</li>
            <li>100g wholemeal flour , plus extra for rolling</li>
            <li>1 large garlic clove</li>
            <li>15g fresh coriander , chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegan bouillon powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>85g red cabbage , finely shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Pile the corn, red onion and pepper into a large shallow roasting tin and toss with the cumin seeds and oil. Add the kiwi and tomato on one side of the tin and roast for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix 60ml water into the flour with the blade of a knife to make a dough. Knead briefly until smooth, then cut equally into four and roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 16cm round tortilla. Cover with a tea towel to stop them drying out.</li>
            <li>Remove the cooked tomato and kiwi from the tin and return the veg to the oven for 10 mins. Remove the skin from the kiwi and scoop the flesh into a bowl with the tomato, garlic, half the coriander, bouillon and paprika. Use a hand blender to blitz to a smooth salsa.</li>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick frying pan, without oil, and cook the tortillas one at a time for a minute on one side and about 10 seconds on the other, until you see them puff up a little. Spread a tortilla with some salsa, top with cabbage and roasted veg, then scatter with the remaining coriander. Add a spoonful more salsa and eat with your hands.</li>
